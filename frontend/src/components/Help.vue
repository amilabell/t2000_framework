    <h2>About this framework</h2>
    This web-application was developed as part of a paper for my computer science studies.<br/> 
    It gives suggestions for UI-adaptions for a selected country, based on the Hofstede dimension scores of the respective locale.
    Those suggestions are based on a literature research, the result of which can be found in the aforementioned paper.

    <h2>Hofstedes Dimensions</h2>
    Hofstede, a famous anthropologist, developed a cross-cultural framework based on five dimensions.<br>
    Those dimensions are:<br/>
    <b>Power Distance (pdi):</b><br/>
    Power Distance describes to what extend the less powerful members of a society accept their position and approve of the unequal distribution of power.
    <p/><b>Individualism vs. Collectivism (idv):</b><br/>
    This dimension describes whether individuals see the affilitation to a group as a main building block of their identity.<br/>
    Members of highly individualistic countries are only loosely tied together by groups. They are mostly focused on themselves or small groups like close relatives.
    <p/><b>Masculinity vs. Femininity(mas):</b><br/>
    Masculinity vs. Femininity is used to illustrate the extend to which a society is has clearly distinct emotional gender roles.<br/>
    In masculine cultures, men are expected to be tough and assertive whereas women are supposed to be fragile and emotional.
    <p/><b>Uncertainty Avoidance (uai):</b><br/>
    This dimension descirbes the extend to which members of a society feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations
    <p/><b>Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (lto):</b>
    Long-term oriented cultures are focused on the future, oriented towards perservance and thrift. Short-term oriented culture however, value the past and present. They have high respect for tradition.
    <p/>
    The previously mentioned paper describes the development of the framework, the dimensions and possible critique regarding this concept in depth.
